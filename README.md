Been around the **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb twice, emailed everyone once.\
Seen *Windows 3.1 crash to DOS*, been *mIRC kid-scripter* a mls writer.\
I even used the real f-ing ***Napster***.

I story/content/script-write anywhere and everywhere. I do it more often than any other word or snippet pusher around.

I'm a soft-bodied, hairy-chested, rootin'-tootin' typewriting, mouse clicking, Tab spacing, thinking writer. 

There ain't anything I can't do.\
No code too complex, no script too buggy, no language too tough.

Learned a lot of lessons in my life.\
Never leave tag's open for the editor to close.\
Used all kind of lines. ISDN, Adsl, FTTH and that slow mfer that call and go "**tsss ntin tsssss sshhhh**" when you press connect.

Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing.\
Moderation is for net administrators.

I'm a chromebook lover, Fedora user.\
I'm a *'lone survivor'*[^1] writer. I write!!! Words with brackets intertwine, and git push-it before the Wi-Fi signal dies.

So, if you are like me, then you better say it, because this dyslexic storytelling monkey been there, done that, and logged on for more.

Cheers, boys, and gals.
